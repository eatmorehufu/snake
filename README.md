# Conway's Game of Snake

[Live](http://www.deanhu.com/snake)

## About
I created a fairly standard implementation of the classic game Snake using
primarily CSS, javascript, and jQuery. I decided to add a little bit of flair
by having the snake body spawn new living cells that obey the rules of
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

## Features
* Javascript game back-end with a jQuery and CSS front end.
* Ability to pause and watch animations flow without the distraction of death.
* Graphically unique playthroughs. 
* A vegetarian snake.
